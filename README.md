This repository is intended to host the PDFs linked via the QR code on the timelines and to be read as [timeline24.github.io/timeline_language.pdf](timeline24.github.io/timeline_en.pdf). It also hosts a copy or fork of the project that creates these pdfs,  [https://github.com/kreier/timeline](https://github.com/kreier/timeline). The pdfs are created with python, reportlab (until 4.6) and fpdf2 (from 4.7 on).
